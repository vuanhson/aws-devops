# Scenario

Animals4life.org is the scenario used throughout the course as a real-world like situation to explain theory and demonstrate practical examples.

- Animal Rescue and Awareness Organization
- Global company, HQ in Brisbane Australia, with 100 staff
- Call center, IT, Admin, Marketing, Legal, Accounting etc... teams
- 100~ remote workers across Australia and Globally
- Animal care, Activists and Lobbyists
- Major office in London, Newyork, Seattle

## Current infrastructure is a mess:
- Small onpremises datacenter in Brisbane, DC is old and company manages them encouraging customers to migrate out as soon as possible
- Badly implemented AWS trial in Sydney region
- A few isolated GCP/Azure pilots
- Global offices and mobile staff untilize Brisbane Infrastructure
- Cost-conscious but progressive management team

## Current problems: 
- Legacy on-premises hardware is failing
- AWS/Azure pilots are messy and not best practice
- Because of distance, there are performance issues for field workers
- Lack of HA and scalability, because of hardware is expensive
- Staff skills/capabilities struggle little automation
- Global expansion concerns - cost for new infrastructure

## Ideal outcomes
- Fast performance for all field workers
- Able to deploy to new regions quickly when required
- Low cost & Scalable base infrastructure
- Agility - spin up new marketing campaigns, social and progressive applications (IOT, Bigdata etc...)
- Automation - low base staffing costs
